# Attendance_criteria_for_examinations

The aim of this project is to calculate attendance of a particular student and check whether the aggregate is sufficient to allow students to write exams or not. 
If not sufficient check for the condonation criteria and if satisfies allow the student to write exams by paying fine. If the student is not even eligible for condonation then he will not be allowed to write exams.
